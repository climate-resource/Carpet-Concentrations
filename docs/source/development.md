## Versioning

This package follows the version format described in
[PEP440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Since our commit messages are
written to follow the
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification, comitizen can use the commit messages since the last release to
determine whether a major, minor or patch release is required automatically.
See the docs for the
[commitizen bump](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/bump/)
command for additional details about the version bumping process and
[](releasing-reference) for additional details about how we do releases in
this project.
