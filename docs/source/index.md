# Carpet - Concentrations

```{include} ../../README.md
:start-after: <!--- sec-begin-description -->

These files are often called flying carpets, hence the name. Such gridded
files can be developed for use cases beyond greenhouse gas concentrations,
hence this repository should be seen as a subset of wider 'carpet'
functionality.
