    abstract = {Abstract Longitude–latitude grids are commonly used for surface analyses and data storage in GIS. For volumetric analyses, three-dimensional meshes perpendicularly raised above or below the gridded surface are applied. Since grids and meshes are defined with geographic coordinates, they are not equal area or volume due to convergence of the meridians and radii. This article compiles and presents known geodetic considerations and relevant formulae needed for longitude–latitude grid and mesh analyses in GIS. The effect of neglecting these considerations is demonstrated on area and volume calculations of ecological marine units.},
